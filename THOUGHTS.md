Animating loading spinners with CSS

Loading spinners and CSS animation

So we keep waiting, waiting on the page to load

Loading spinners are the new elevator music

## Summary

We spend so much time waiting for things on the web that you'd think we actually like waiting. Ideally we'd never have to wait, but loading spinners and animations are wonderful little UI hints to users of our web applications that things are actually happening. It turns out they're also a pretty neat way to exercise some creative curiosity with the sweet suite of tools provided by the CSS animation API.


## BIO

I'm a software developer with Blake eLearning. I mainly spend my time wrangling JavaScript but I like to play around with just about anything web development. I'll talk your ear off about football (soccer) given the chance and I'll tell you without any bias that my kid is the cutest.


## Intro Questions

### 1. What is one thing that people donâ€™t know about you?

I used to ride motocross bikes in high school, I jumped off ramps and did some OK tricks

### 2. When you were a child what did you want to be?

Airforce pilot, but my dreams were dashed by these faulty eyes

### 3. What was the first website you built?

Something terrible on GeoCities, it had a visitor counter and a cursor trail. I got paid to build in high school to build a tourism website for my hometown.

## A brain dump of talk ideas

Obligatory photo of Millie, cute then cranky. "Look how cute she is! But she's nearly 3 so we're seeing much more of this"

Animation ideas:

* Simple rotation spin
* Concentric spinning dots or lines, alternate direction
* Three bouncing balls, offset, bezier curves

Live coding or modification of examples? Or just new slides with changes

Some anecdote about fidget spinners?
